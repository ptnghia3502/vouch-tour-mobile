A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Push Notification checklist
- [x] Add Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to receive notification
- [ ] Send FCM token to Firebase Realtime Database
- [ ] Show notification while the app is running on foreground using flutter_local_notification
- [ ] Store notification to SQLite then show on the notification page (currently unable to test because the notification page cannot access)
